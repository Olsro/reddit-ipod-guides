# Tip me on Patreon
All my knowledge is shared publicly. I want to avoid gate-keeping of the knowledge, so as many person as possible can get access to it thus avoiding doing mistakes that I've made and that cost time. Also, kids or many financially poor person can't afford paying for virtual things on the Internet but should still have the opportunity to learn new things without having to rely on pirates who leak the gate-keeped content.

If you can and if you feel that my work deserves a few dollars, you can easily tip me on Patreon to support it which encourages me to pursue this activity and even sometimes give private additional individual helps when I can to anyone: https://www.patreon.com/Olsro
